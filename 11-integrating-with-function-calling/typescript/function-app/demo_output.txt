🚀 === Function Calling App Demo ===
This is the LAST and most advanced app project in the Generative AI for Beginners course!

📋 App Overview:
- Integrates Azure OpenAI with custom function calling
- Demonstrates weather lookup using Bing Maps API
- Shows advanced AI capabilities with external data sources

🎯 Function Calling Demonstration:
==================================

👤 User Query: "What's the weather in New York, C?"

🧠 AI Processing:
- Azure OpenAI receives the query
- AI recognizes this needs the findWeather function
- Function definition sent to AI:
{
  "name": "findWeather",
  "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "location": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
      },
      "unit": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": [
          "C",
          "F"
        ]
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "location"
    ]
  }
}

⚡ Function Call Triggered:
📡 Function: findWeather
📝 Arguments: {"location":"New York","unit":"C"}

🌤️  Executing Weather Lookup:
🔍 Calling Bing Maps API for: New York (C)
✅ Weather data retrieved successfully!

📊 Weather Result:
==================
📍 Location: New York
🌡️  Temperature: 22°C
☁️  Condition: Partly cloudy
💧 Humidity: 65%
💨 Wind Speed: 8 km/h
⏰ Updated: 2025-09-08T13:56:59.314Z

✨ Final AI Response:
"The current weather in New York is 22°C with partly cloudy conditions. The humidity is 65% and wind speed is 8 km/h."
